Equation Grapher

Use this program to see what a certain x vs y function looks like!
In order to graph an equation, you must enter the x and y bounds
as well as the equation itself.
Once an equation is entered, press "Graph" and the graph will be 
displayed in the panel.
Available Symbols:
	Numeric Symbols: 0123456789
		Because we are doing math, we need numbers
	'x'
		so that you can graph vs an unknown
		y = x
	'(' and ')' 
		in order to separate clauses, etc.
		y = (x + x) + x
	'^'
		exponents
		y = x^2
	'*','/','+','-'
		the basic math operators
		y = x * 2
		y = 2 / x
		y = 1 + 1
		y = x - 4
	'e'
		the mathematical e
		y = e^x
	'p'
		represents pi
		y = p*2
	'l' 
		represents the natural log
		takes the natural log of the element immendiately after it
			make sure to put necessary parantheses in
		y = lx
	
Notes:
	Must have an operator between numeric symbols/values
		The exception to this is l in which case lx works
	For only zero values, only use one zero or nothing will graph properly
		I.e. y = x - 0 works whereas y = x - 00 will not
